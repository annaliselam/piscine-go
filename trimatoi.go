//Write a function that transforms a number within a string, in an int.

// For this exercise the handling of the - sign has to be taken into account. If the sign is encountered before any number it should determine the sign of the returned int.

// This function will only return an int. In case of invalid input, the function should return 0.

// Note: There will never be more than one sign by string in the tests.
